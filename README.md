# PCA‑Based Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard for an Automated Filling Line

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to real-world automated filling line data to uncover variability, detect anomalies, and support continuous improvement. The final deliverable is an interactive dashboard that visualises PCA insights, process stability, and early warning indicators.
